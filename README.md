## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/investment-tracker.git
cd investment-tracker
```

### 2. Install PHP dependencies

Make sure you have Composer installed.

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Install Node dependencies (for Bootstrap and Chart.js)

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

### 4. Configure your .env file

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then generate the application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Now open the .env file and set your database credentials:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=investmenttracker
DB_USERNAME=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
```

### 5. Set up the database

**Option 1**: Import the provided SQL file
You can import the investmenttracker.sql file directly into your MySQL server:

```bash
mysql -u your_mysql_username -p investmenttracker < investmenttracker.sql
```

**Option 2**: Run migrations (if no SQL file)
If you prefer to migrate manually:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

And seed the database with demo data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### 6. Database Seeding Details

The application comes with two seeders:

1. **UserSeeder**: Creates demo user accounts for testing
2. **DatabaseSeeder**: Populates the database with sample investment data

The seeders leverage Laravel's Factory system to generate realistic test data for:
- Fixed Deposits with varying interest rates and maturity dates
- Property investments with location and valuation details
- Stock investments with price and quantity information

Run the seeders to quickly populate your database with test data:

```bash
# Run all seeders
php artisan db:seed

# Run specific seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
```

### 7. Serve the app

```bash
php artisan serve
```
